# Vaccine-Receiver-Prediction-Model


## Problem Statement
Your goal is to predict how likely individuals are to receive their xyz and seasonal flu
vaccines. Specifically, you'll be predicting two probabilities: one for xyz_vaccine and
one for seasonal_vaccine.

## Solution
In this multi label classification problem, I have made predictions using 3 models.
1. Logistic regression model
2. Random forest model
3. XGBoost classifier model

Each model gave ROC AUC score in range 0.83-0.86
